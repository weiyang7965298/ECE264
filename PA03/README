In this assignment, we will read a file full of integers, sort them,
and then search for particular values. You will do this by editing the
file "answer03.c". You should not edit any other files.

To pass this assignment, just fill in the blanks in answer03.c. The
comments in this file are there to guide you. You can (and should)
create extra functions as needed. Please take care to follow the
coding standards of the course. (For example, do not use any static
variables.)

Once you finish the solution, and it passes all of the testcases, and
everything is *neat* and *tiddy* in your source file, and you compile
without warnings, then please submit it to blackboard. 

===============================
== To Sumbit Your Assignment ==
===============================

You must submit a zip file called "pa03.zip", with precisely two files
in it: "answer03.c", and "my-log.text". You must submit only those
two files, and they must be named precisely as described.

=====================================================

In PA03-PA05, you need to show evidence of using version control.  You
can use any version control system (such as CVS, SVN, RCS...).  This
course encourages you to use github.com because you can request free
private repositories as a student.  Please visit 

https://github.com/edu

to get your free private repositories.  You *MUST* use a private
repository.  If you use a public repository (visible by everyone in
the world) and someone copies your solution, you will be considered
cheating.  You will receive F and your name will be reported to the
Dean of Students.

The evidence is the log (or history) of your commit.  You should
commit often (at least once a day).  You can commit once an hour, or
even once every 10 minutes. Each commit takes a snapshot of your
programs.  If you commit, you can easily recover from mistakes.  If
you do not commit, you will not have any history of the progress.  To
meet the requirement of PA03-PA05, you must commit *at least three*
times and each of a meaningful message.  In the rare cases when a
student is suspected cheating, the student's commit log may be
considered as an evidence for defense.


For your reference, this is the commit log of the programming
assignments.
